The Data Compliance API enables the deletion of personal data associated with an individual’s email address from Ada’s databases. This includes identifying the chatter ID linked to the provided email address and removing all records associated with that chatter ID.

Data deletion requests may take up to 30 days to fully process and be removed from Ada’s databases.

This API supports compliance with data deletion requirements under applicable laws, such as GDPR. However, it may not fully satisfy all data deletion requests, especially if the provided email address is not linked to a chatter ID.

## Rate limit

The Data compliance API is subject to the [global rate limits](https://docs.ada.cx/generative/reference/introduction/limits).
